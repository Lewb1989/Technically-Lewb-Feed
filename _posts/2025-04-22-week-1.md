🚨 **GTA VI Leaks Continue**  
More potential in-game footage has been leaked again on Reddit. Rockstar still hasn't confirmed, but speculation is boiling over.

🎬 **Call of Duty: Black Ops Hollywood?**  
New rumors suggest CoD 2025 might shift to a 90s action movie theme. Think Die Hard meets Tactical Ops. What do you think?

🕹️ **Crazy New Tech - The Haptic VR Suit**  
Startup 'HaptiCore' has dropped a full-body VR suit that lets you “feel” your games. Too much or just right?

Stay tuned — more coming next week.
